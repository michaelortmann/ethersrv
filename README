ethersrv-linux is an implementation of EtherSRV for Linux. It allows a Linux
computer to share its drive over Ethernet with multiple DOS clients running
EtherDFS.

This is version 20180203 from http://etherdfs.sourceforge.net/ plus some
patches by me.

Thanks and Greetings to Mateusz Viste.

Enjoy,
