ethersrv is an implementation of EtherSRV for Linux and FreeBSD. It allows a
Linux or FreeBSD computer to share its drive over Ethernet with multiple DOS
clients running EtherDFS.

This is version 20180203 from http://etherdfs.sourceforge.net/ plus FreeBSD port
and some other patches by me. The FreeBSD port works, but file attributes are
more or less not working yet.

Thanks and Greetings to Mateusz Viste.

Enjoy,
